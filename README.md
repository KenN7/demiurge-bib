# DEMIURGE-BIB

## How to use this repository

In order for this repository to work best, create a folder for all your papers.
Open a terminal in that folder and run:

    git clone https://github.com/demiurge-project/demiurge-bib.git demiurge-bib

In your .tex file include the following line to access the references:

    \bibliography{../demiurge-bib/authors,../demiurge-bib/addresses,../demiurge-bib/proceedings,../demiurge-bib/journals,../demiurge-bib/publishers,../demiurge-bib/series,../demiurge-bib/schools,../demiurge-bib/bibliography}

## How to contribute to the repository

1. Read the guidelines carefully.
2. Create a working copy of the repository (by branching or forking).
3. Edit the files according to the guidelines.  
   Please check if an entry is already present before adding it.
4. Commit your changes to your working copy.
5. Create a pull request from your working copy to the master branch.
6. We will review your edits and if they meet the standards outlined in this file, we will accept the pull request.

### What is a good commit message?

A good commit message consists of several parts.  
First comes one line that summarizes your edits. This line will be shown in the preview of github. Candidates for such a line could be "Added entries from GECCO2020", "Uploaded bibliography for ANTS2018 submission", "Fixed authors with more than two names".

Then you should add details of what you changed. These changes should be summarized in the form:

    file:
    [key] added/modified/deleted

For example a good commit message could look like this:

    Updated author names for ANTS2018 paper of Kuckling et al.

    author.bib
    [Kuckling_J] added
    [Birattari_M] modified

    bibliography.bib
    [KucLigBozBir2018ants] modified
    [KucLigBozBir2018ants-supp] modified

### How do I create a pull request?

Use the github UI to create a pull request.
Select from demiurge-project/demiurge-bib the master branch as the base and your working copy as the compare branch.

## General guidelines

### How to choose the type of entry

* @Article:  
  Articles that have been published in a journal
* @InProceedings:  
  Articles that have been published in the proceedings of a conference
* @Book:  
  Books written by one or several authors
* @InCollection:  
  Works written by one or several authors, that are part of a collection (i.e. an appended collection of manuscripts from several authors)
* @PhDThesis:  
  PhD theses,
  if the thesis also was published as a book, cite the book instead
* @MastersThesis:  
  Master's theses
* @TechReport:  
  Technical reports
* @Misc:  
  Everything else (e.g. websites, software manuals, ...)  

### Generating a label for the entry

The label follows the general convention of ```[Authors][Year][Source]```.  
This differs from our previous standard by removing the colon ```:```.

##### Generating the author list in the label

The full rules can be found at http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/wiki/Conventions_for_Bibtex_labels  
As a summary: For up to four authors take the first three letters of each name, capitalize only the first letter of each name.
For more than four authors take the first three letters of the first three authors, capitalize only the first letter of each name. Then add ```-etal```.  

##### Generating the source identifier

For journals and proceedings use the same identifier as the key in the file ```journal.bib``` or ```proceedings.bib```. Note that for journals the identifier should be capitalized (e.g. SI), while for proceedings it should be uncapitalized (e.g. ants).  
For books, technical reports, phd teses, and master's theses the identifier is ```book```, ```techrep```, ```phd``` and ```master``` respectively.  
For works in collections and miscellaneous entries no general rule can be provided. Try to find a meaningful and descriptive identifier. **DO NOT LEAVE THE IDENTIFIER BLANK!**

##### Examples

The paper "Toward the formal foundation of Ant Programming" of Birattari, Di Caro and Dorigo, published 2002 at ANTS, then becomes ```BirDicDor2002ants```.

The paper "Hybrid metaheuristics for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands" of Bianchi, Birattari, Chiarandini, Manfrin, Mastrolilli, Paquete, Rossi-Doria and Schiavinotto, published 2006 in the Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms, then becomes ```BiaBirChi-etal2006JMMA```.

The paper "A Racing Algorithm for Configuring Metaheuristics" of Birattari, St√ºtzle, Paquete and Varrentrapp, published 2002 at GECCO, then becomes ```BirStuPaqVar2002gecco```

### File structure

In order to decrease the variants of spellings for names, journals, conferences, etc. and in order to automate between using long and short versions of keys, this repository contains several files.

* [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib): This file contains all bibliography entries. It will make use of the keys defined in other files.
* [author.bib](author.bib): This file contains entries for names of people. It is used to supply the keys for the fields ```author``` and ```editor```.
* [journal.bib](journal.bib): This file contains entries for journal names. It is used to supply the keys for the field ```journal```.
* [proceedings.bib](proceedings.bib): This file contains entries for proceedings. It is used to supply the keys for the field ```booktitle``` of the @InProceedings entries in bibliography.bib.
* [publisher.bib](publisher.bib): This file contains the entries for all publisher names. It is used to supply the keys for the field ```publisher```.
* [institution.bib](institution.bib): This file contains the entries for all institutions (university, research labs). It supplies the keys for the field ```school``` of the @PhDThesis and @MastersThesis entries and the field ```institution``` of the @TechReport entries in the bibliography.bib.
* [address.bib](address.bib): This file contains entries for addresses (city and country) for all journals and institutions. It supplies the keys for the field ```address```.
* [series.bib](series.bib): This file contains entries for publication series (such as LNCS). It supplies keys for the field ```series```.

The file bibliography.bib contains all bibtex entries. New entries should be appended at the end of this file.
The other files only contain string definitions. These definitions should be kept in alphabetical order with regard to the key of the definition.

All files are indented with four spaces.  
Around the character ```=``` no spaces are used (see templates).

### Bibtex entries
Bibtex entries should be as complete and correct as possible.  
The templates show the necessary information that needs to be included in every entry.  
If some fields are not applicable (e.g. a journal is not part of a series), then leave the field empty (e.g. ```series={}```).
New entries should be added at the end of the file.

### Notes

LNCS (as probably other Springer series as well) issues separate volumes.
The number field is not used in this case.

The field ```doi``` refers only to the identifier, not the URL at doi.org

The field ```address``` should be always of the form ```City, Country``` (e.g. ```Berlin, Germany```, ```Cham, Switzerland```, ```Brussels, Belgium```).  
If the address is located in the United States, use the format ```City, State, Country```, that is ```Piscataway, NJ, USA``` or ```Cambridge, MA, USA```.

For online publications (e.g. papers in an online only journal), specific identifiers should be put into the ```pages``` field.
For example Science Robotics uses a elocation-id (like eaav8006), which should be formatted as ```pages = {eaav8006}```.

We will not escape accents or special characters.
Make sure that your editor is set up with Unicode support (UTF-8 encoding).  

Use sentence case (capitalizing only the first letter) for ```title``` fields.
Words with defined capitalization (proper names, algorithms, etc.) should be escaped using curly braces ```{}``` (e.g. ```{AutoMoDe}```).
Also enclose the full name in the curly braces and not only the parts you want to protect.
Do not use double curly braces as this will prevent the case changing algorithm from working correctly.  
Use title case (capitalizing everything but particles) for book titles.
This affects ```title``` fields of @Book entries, ```booktitle``` fields of @InCollection and @InProceedings (and for @InProceedings especially the value in the proceedings.bib files).  
The booktitle for proceedings (as defined in proceedings.bib) should be as written on the published proceedings.
If the title of the proceedings does not contain a reference to the conference, you can add the abbreviated name and year of the conference (prepended by a comma, e.g. ```, ANTS2018```).

Conferences usually come with proceedings (those should be referenced from the proceedings.bib file).
Sometimes the conferences however also produce extended versions or post-proceedings in special issues of a journal.
In that case the entry should be referenced from the file journal.bib.

Sometimes titles or the list of authors can be long.
However **do not** put a line break in the field, as this hinders the tracking of changes that git can automatically do.
